# Today, I successfully wrote a fundamental artificial neural network from scratch/memory, in about 1000 lines of java code, without Ai libraries, [as I have been doing for around 7 years, approximately every 6 months](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE).
# This is a part of [my Live agile neural network sessions](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Sessions/blob/main/README.md), and [the universal ai diploma](https://www.amazon.in/Spread-your-brains-out-Practitioning-ebook/dp/B0CNYBK3S3) that I teach.
# ChatGPT4 is powered by artificial neural networks, at bottom, similar to this fundamental model I wrote/practice writing from memory/sratch every 6 months or so.

NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE_2024_AUG
Simple artificial neural network written from memory/scratch by God in java.

  Author: God Bennett
  
  Why?: This is practice writing of basic neural network from memory. ([I do this at the end of each year, or sometimes every 6 months](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE), for practice of fundamentals.)

  The problem space is [X-OR inputs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate). So the model does xor input prediction.
  
  Given two numbers in [X-OR space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate), the model will try to guess the output.
  
  For:
  
  a) Input=(0,0) output should be 0
  
  b) Input=(1,0) output should be 1
  
  c) Input=(0,1) output should be 1
  
  d) Input=(1,1) output should be 0
